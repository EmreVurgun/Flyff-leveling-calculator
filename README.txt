# Flyff-leveling-calculator
This is a calculator for the game FlyForFun that calculates the time it takes to get to a certain level in the game from the cartain point you are at.
It is simple and is designed to give accurate results when you are leveling alone and not in a party

How to use:

1. Launch the .exe file
2. Enter the answers to the questions you get on the terminal screen and make sure you use capital letters.
3. If you are leveling with a partner and/or with a party then measure how much extra exp you're getting by fighting a few mobs before you are in a party
and after you are in a party and compare the results to calculate how much more exp you are getting then enter that a number increased by that much when the 
question for it comes. For example if you are using ES amps and you get %50 more exp with a partner and in a party enter 350x1.5 which is 525

If you level alone and without a party then skip 3.
